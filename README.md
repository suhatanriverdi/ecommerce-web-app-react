## Database Schema (Supabase)

This project uses [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) as a backend for storing product information.
Below is the schema used for the `products` table:

### `products` Table

| Column Name   | Data Type | Description                                               |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`          | `integer` | Primary key, auto-incremented                             |
| `title`       | `string`  | Name of the product (e.g., ‚ÄúGreen Cotton T-Shirt‚Äù)        |
| `description` | `text`    | Detailed description of the product                       |
| `category`    | `string`  | Product category (e.g., ‚Äútshirt‚Äù, ‚Äúhoodie‚Äù, ‚Äúsweatpants‚Äù) |
| `price`       | `decimal` | Price of the product                                      |
